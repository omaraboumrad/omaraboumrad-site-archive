Title: Projects

### Projects

One of my hobbies is learning new technologies or new concepts and applying
them in personal projects or experiments. Here's a small list of (not-so)
recent things I've been doing:


[dryorm](https://dryorm.com/ee2136c0-4584-4cee-a15e-00e73eee0b19) - object relational mapper playground (open source) [Python, Django, Channels, Queue, Docker]

[brawlers](https://brawlers.info) - cybercafe layout dashboard (closed source, for now) [Javascript, React, SVG, Firebase]

[mastool](https://github.com/omaraboumrad/mastool) - static analysis checks of python code through flake8 (open source) [Python, Flake8]

[bosta](https://github.com/mena-devs/bosta) - pluggable slack bot [Javascript, Slack]

[vim-life](https://github.com/omaraboumrad/vim-life) - vim plugin for conway's game of life [Vim, Python]

My hello world when learning different languages is to create  rudimentary irc
bots. The exercise allows me to test different aspects of the language at hand
from networking to string manipulation and regular expressions.

[python](https://github.com/omaraboumrad/pythonbot)
[go](https://gist.github.com/omaraboumrad/98d17f61625711a23e9b)
[luabot](https://github.com/omaraboumrad/luabot)
[javascript](https://gist.github.com/omaraboumrad/280f25bb2df0794aa671a64ee4dfd1a5)

I also tend to create a lot of snippets of code to share or store for later
reference and since Github doesn't have a friendly gist listing you can find
a friendly listing here
