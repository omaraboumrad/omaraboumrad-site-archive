After a semi-long career of software, I found myself intrigued by electronics.
It's quite facinating to be build something that you can actually _touch_!

I figured I'd follow a bottom-up approach in learning so I started trying to
build some fundamental circuit components.

- [OR Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWdX2fgL8N0)
- [AND Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AQj9rQeYug)
- [INVERTER Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKlzMU7qE2I)

Though that quickly became quite boring partly due to not understand too much
of what I was trying to do. Then I figured I'd start experimenting with some
components like transistors, relays and so on. That quickly gave me my first
every idea for a tiny project! The water level meter!

This was so fulfilling! It truly felt like I've achieved a milestone, inspite of
what some would consider a simple circuit. Nevertheless, this track's excitement
grew so I started eyeballing microcontrollers. A couple of
friends suggested following the Arduino track and purchase a kit. I got a hold
of a pretty cheap one from a site online which had a good bundle of components
as well as an arduino board and shields. The total price paid was around $50.

The very first tests revolved around a few sensors and other components 
acquired in local shops.

- [Photo Resistor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZnGwGHJt3s)
- [Ultrasonic Sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQCJyIx6KAw)
- [Joystick and Display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG6d3kj0w6s)

These were quite fun, but it never came close to the water level meter probably
because the other was somewhat *complete*? Still, the thirst for more kept
pushing me to do something slightly more complex. I got familiar with the
_L293D_ motor driver which for the lack of better words would allow me to
control motors. There were many failures (all of which were recorded) but in the
end not only was I able to get an automated _robot_ running, the real success
was extracing the entire circuit out of the arduino board and onto a custom
circuit!

Here's to hoping I can find the time to get back into playing with electronics,
it is quite fun and everyone should try it!
